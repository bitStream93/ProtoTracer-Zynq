REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 Protogen_i/Matrix_Driver/inst/Matrix_Buffer/ram_block_reg_1_0 has an input control pin Protogen_i/Matrix_Driver/inst/Matrix_Buffer/ram_block_reg_1_0/ADDRBWRADDR[10] (net: Protogen_i/Matrix_Driver/inst/Matrix_Buffer/ram_block_reg_2_2_2[7]) which is driven by a register (Protogen_i/Matrix_Driver/inst/led_driver/s_ram_addr_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
